\newpage
# 23 Dec 2020

Note the newline on the first line. I found that sometimes pandoc won't add
two newlines to concatenated files and will cause formatting issues from Markdown,
so I add a blank line at the start to help mitigate that.

I also added a `\newpage` directive to this first note file so that the table
of contents will have its own page.
